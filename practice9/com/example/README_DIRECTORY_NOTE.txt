Per system configuration, the working directory for tooling and automation remains c:/Oracle/Labs/practice9. However, all further actions can be performed relative to com/example as if it is the working root, by prefixing commands and file operations appropriately. If you require command-line usage from within 'com/example', please open a terminal in that folder manually in your IDE or file explorer.

Tasks:
- All file edits/additions will use the path prefix 'com/example/' to operate as if they are in that directory.
- Please provide files/commands as if operating in 'com/example' when making future requests.
